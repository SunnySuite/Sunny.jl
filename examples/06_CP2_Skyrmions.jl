# # 6. Dynamical quench into CP¬≤ skyrmion liquid
#
# This example demonstrates a non-equilibrium study of SU(3) spin dynamics
# leading to the formation of a CP¬≤ skyrmion liquid. As proposed in [Zhang et
# al., Nature Communications **14**, 3626
# (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39232-8), CP¬≤ skyrmions are
# topological defects that involve both the dipolar and quadrupolar parts of
# quantum spin-1, and can be studied using the formalism SU(3) coherent states.
#
# This study uses the SU(N) generalization of Landau-Lifshitz spin dynamics,
# with Langevin coupling to a thermal bath, as described in [Dahlbom et al.,
# Phys. Rev. B **106**, 235154
# (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.235154). Beginning from an
# initial high-temperature state, the dynamics following a rapid quench in
# temperature gives rise a disordered liquid of CP¬≤ skyrmions.
