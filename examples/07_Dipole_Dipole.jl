# # 7. Long-range dipole interactions
#
# This example demonstrates long-range dipole-dipole interactions in the context
# of a spin wave calculation. These interactions can be included two ways: with
# infinite-range [Ewald summation](@ref enable_dipole_dipole!) or with a
# [real-space distance cutoff](@ref
# modify_exchange_with_truncated_dipole_dipole!). The study follows [Del Maestro
# and Gingras, J. Phys.: Cond. Matter, **16**, 3339
# (2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0403494).
