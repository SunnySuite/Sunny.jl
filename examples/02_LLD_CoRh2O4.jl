# # 2. Landau-Lifshitz dynamics of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ at finite *T*
#
# In the [previous tutorial](@ref "1. Spin wave simulations of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ"), we
# used spin wave theory to calculate the dynamical spin structure factor of
# CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ. Here, we perform a similar calculation using equilibrium samples from
# the Boltzmann distribution at finite ``T``. For each sampled spin
# configuration, we will simulate the classical Landau-Lifshitz spin dynamics
# and extract dynamical spin-spin correlations. After applying a
# classical-to-quantum correction factor, the resulting intensities can be
# compared to inelastic neutron scattering data.

# Construct the CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ antiferromagnet as before. Energy minimization yields
# the expected N√©el order.

# ### Langevin dynamics for sampling

# We will be using a [`Langevin`](@ref) spin dynamics to thermalize the system.
# This dynamics is a variant of the Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates
# noise and dissipation terms, which are linked by a fluctuation-dissipation
# theorem. The temperature 16 K ‚âà 1.38 meV is slightly above ordering for this
# model. The dimensionless `damping` magnitude sets a timescale for coupling to
# the implicit thermal bath; 0.2 is usually a good choice.

langevin = Langevin(; damping=0.2, kT=16*units.K)

# Use [`suggest_timestep`](@ref) to select an integration timestep. A
# dimensionless error tolerance of `1e-2` is usually a good choice. The
# suggested timestep will vary according to the magnetic configuration. It is
# reasonable to start from an energy-minimized configuration.

suggest_timestep(sys, langevin; tol=1e-2)
langevin.dt = 0.025;

# Now run a Langevin trajectory to sample spin configurations. Keep track of the
# energy per site at each time step.

# From the relaxed spin configuration, we can learn that `dt` was a little
# smaller than necessary; increasing it will make the remaining simulations
# faster.

# ### Static structure factor

# Use [`SampledCorrelationsStatic`](@ref) to estimate spatial correlations for
# configurations in classical thermal equilibrium. Measure [`ssf_perp`](@ref),
# which is appropriate for unpolarized neutron scattering. Include the

# accumulate data for the current spin snapshot.

# Use [`q_space_grid`](@ref) to define a slice of momentum space ``[H, K, 0]``,
# where ``H`` and ``K`` each range from -10 to 10 in RLU. This command produces

# ### Dynamical structure factor

# To collect statistics for the _dynamical_ structure factor intensities
# ``\mathcal{S}(ùê™,œâ)`` at finite temperature, use
# [`SampledCorrelations`](@ref). It requires a range of `energies` to resolve,
# which will be associated with frequencies of the classical spin dynamics. The
# integration timestep `dt` can be somewhat larger than that used by the
# Langevin dynamics.

energies = range(0, 6, 50)
sc = SampledCorrelations(sys; dt, energies, measure)

# Like before, use Langevin dynamics to sample spin configurations from thermal
# equilibrium. Now, however, each call to [`add_sample!`](@ref) will run a
# classical spin dynamics trajectory and measure dynamical correlations. To make
# the tutorial run quickly, we average over just 5 trajectories. To make a
# publication quality figure, this number should be significantly increased for
# better statistics.
