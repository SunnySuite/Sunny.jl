# # 3. Multi-flavor spin wave simulations of FeI₂
# 
# This tutorial illustrates various advanced features such as symmetry analysis,
# energy minimization, and spin wave theory with multi-flavor bosons.
#
# Our context will be FeI₂, an effective spin-1 material with strong single-ion
# anisotropy. Quadrupolar fluctuations give rise to a single-ion bound state
# that is observable in neutron scattering, and cannot be described by a
# dipole-only model. We will use the linear spin wave theory of SU(3) coherent
# states (i.e. 2-flavor bosons) to model the magnetic spectrum of FeI₂. The
# original study was performed in [Bai et al., Nature Physics **17**, 467–472
# (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

#
# The Fe atoms are arranged in stacked triangular layers. The effective spin
# Hamiltonian takes the form,
# 
# ```math
# \mathcal{H}=\sum_{(i,j)} 𝐒_i ⋅ J_{ij} 𝐒_j - D\sum_i \left(S_i^z\right)^2,
# ```
#
# where the exchange matrices ``J_{ij}`` between bonded sites ``(i,j)`` include
# competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. This model also
# includes a strong easy axis anisotropy, ``D > 0``.

# information for spacegroup 164.

# ### Symmetry analysis
#
# The command [`print_symmetry_table`](@ref) provides a list of all the
# symmetry-allowed interactions out to 8 Å.

print_symmetry_table(cryst, 8.0)

# The allowed ``g``-tensor is expressed as a 3×3 matrix in the free coefficients
# `A`, `B`, ... The allowed single-ion anisotropy is expressed as a linear
# combination of Stevens operators. The latter correspond to polynomials of the
# spin operators, as we will describe below.
# 
# The allowed exchange interactions are given as 3×3 matrices for representative
# bonds. The notation `Bond(i, j, n)` indicates a bond between atom indices `i`
# and `j`, with cell offset `n`. Note that the order of the pair ``(i, j)`` is
# significant if the exchange tensor contains antisymmetric
# Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interactions.
# 
# The bonds can be visualized in the `view_crystal` interface. By default,
# `Bond(1, 1, [1,0,0])` is toggled on, to show the 6 nearest-neighbor Fe-Fe
# bonds on a triangular lattice layer. Toggling `Bond(1, 1, [0,0,1])` shows the
# Fe-Fe bond between layers, etc.

# ### Defining the spin model

# Construct a [`System`](@ref) with spin $s=1$ and $g=2$ for the Fe ions.
#
# Recall that quantum spin-1 is, in reality, a linear combination of basis
# states ``|m⟩`` with well-defined angular momentum ``m = -1, 0, 1``. FeI₂ has a
# strong easy-axis anisotropy, which stabilizes a single-ion bound state of zero
# angular momentum, ``|m=0⟩``. Such a bound state is inaccessible to traditional
# spin wave theory, which works with dipole expectation values of fixed
# magnitude. This physics is, however, well captured with a theory of SU(_N_)
# coherent states, where ``N = 2S+1 = 3`` is the number of levels. Activate this
# generalized theory by selecting `:SUN` mode instead of `:dipole` mode.
#
# An optional `seed` for random number generation can be used to to make the
# calculation exactly reproducible.

# ### Finding the ground state

# This model has been fitted so that energy minimization yields the physically
# correct ground state. Knowing this, we could set the magnetic configuration
# manually by calling [`set_dipole!`](@ref) on each site in the system. Another
# approach, as we will demonstrate, is to search for the ground-state via
# [`minimize_energy!`](@ref).
#
# To reduce bias in the search, use [`resize_supercell`](@ref) to create a
# relatively large system of 4×4×4 chemical cells. Randomize all spins
# (represented as SU(3) coherent states) and minimize the energy.

sys = resize_supercell(sys, (4, 4, 4))
randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys)

# The positive step-count above indicates successful convergence to a local
# energy minimum. Defects, however, are visually apparent.

plot_spins(sys; color=[S[3] for S in sys.dipoles])

# One could precisely quantify the Fourier-space static structure factor
# ``\mathcal{S}(𝐪)`` of this spin configuration using
# [`SampledCorrelationsStatic`](@ref). For the present purposes, however, it is
# most convenient to use [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref), which effectively
# averages ``\mathcal{S}(𝐪)`` over all Brillouin zones.

print_wrapped_intensities(sys)

# The known zero-field energy-minimizing magnetic structure of FeI₂ is a two-up,
# two-down order. It can be described as a generalized spiral with a single
# propagation wavevector ``𝐤``. Rotational symmetry allows for three equivalent
# orientations: ``±𝐤 = [0, -1/4, 1/4]``, ``[1/4, 0, 1/4]``, or
# ``[-1/4,1/4,1/4]``. Energy minimization of large systems can easily get
# trapped in a metastable state with competing domains and defects. Nonetheless,
# `print_wrapped_intensities` shows that a non-trivial fraction of the total
# intensity is consistent with known ordering wavevectors.
#
# Let's break the three-fold symmetry by hand. The function
# [`suggest_magnetic_supercell`](@ref) takes any number of ``𝐤`` modes and
# suggests a magnetic cell shape that is commensurate with all of them.

suggest_magnetic_supercell([[0, -1/4, 1/4]])

# Using the minimal system returned by [`reshape_supercell`](@ref), it is now
# easy to find the ground state. Plot the system again, now including "ghost"
# spins out to 12Å, to verify that the magnetic order is consistent with FeI₂.

plot_spins(sys_min; color=[S[3] for S in sys_min.dipoles], ghost_radius=12)

# ### Spin wave theory
#
# Now that the system has been relaxed to an energy minimized ground state, we
# can calculate the spin wave spectrum. Because we are working with a system of
# SU(3) coherent states, this calculation will require a multi-flavor boson
# generalization of the usual spin wave theory.

swt = SpinWaveTheory(sys_min; measure=ssf_perp(sys_min))

# Calculate and plot the spectrum along a momentum-space path that connects a
# sequence of high-symmetry ``𝐪``-points. This interface abstracts over the
# underlying calculator type.

res = intensities_bands(swt, path)
plot_intensities(res; units, title="Single Crystal Bands")

# To make direct comparison with inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data, we
# must account for empirical broadening of the data. Model this using a
# [`lorentzian`](@ref) kernel, with a full-width at half-maximum of 0.3 meV.

kernel = lorentzian(fwhm=0.3)
energies = range(0, 10, 300);  # 0 < ω < 10 (meV)

# Also, a real FeI₂ sample will exhibit competing magnetic domains. We use
# [`domain_average`](@ref) to average over the three possible domain
# orientations. This involves 120° rotations about the axis ``\hat{z} = [0, 0,
# 1]`` in global Cartesian coordinates.

rotations = [([0,0,1], n*(2π/3)) for n in 0:2]
weights = [1, 1, 1]
res = domain_average(cryst, path; rotations, weights) do path_rotated
    intensities(swt, path_rotated; energies, kernel)
end

# This result can be directly compared to experimental neutron scattering data
# from [Bai et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1)

# (The publication figure used a non-standard coordinate system to label the
# wave vectors.)
# 
# To get this agreement, the theory of SU(3) coherent states is essential. The
# lower band has large quadrupolar character, and arises from the strong
# easy-axis anisotropy of FeI₂.
#
# An interesting exercise is to repeat the same study, but using `:dipole` mode
# instead of `:SUN`. That alternative choice would constrain the coherent state
# dynamics to the space of dipoles only, and the flat band of single-ion bound
# states would be missing.
