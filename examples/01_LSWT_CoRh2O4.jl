# # 1. Spin wave simulations of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ
#
# This tutorial introduces Sunny through its features for performing
# conventional spin wave theory calculations. We consider the crystal CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ
# and reproduce the calculations of [Ge et al., Phys. Rev. B **96**,
# 064413 (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.064413).

# ### Get Julia and Sunny
# 
# Sunny is implemented in Julia, which allows for interactive development (like
# Python or Matlab) while also providing high numerical efficiency (like C++ or
# Fortran). New Julia users should begin with our **[Getting
# Started](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/wiki/Getting-started-with-Julia)**
# guide. Sunny requires Julia 1.10 or later.
#
# From the Julia prompt, load Sunny and also [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/)
# for graphics.

using Sunny, GLMakie

# If these packages are not yet installed, Julia will offer to install them. If
# executing this tutorial gives an error, you may need to update Sunny and
# GLMakie from the [built-in package
# manager](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/wiki/Getting-started-with-Julia#the-built-in-julia-package-manager).

# ### Units system

# The [`Units`](@ref Units) object selects reference energy and length scales,
# and uses these to provide physical constants. For example, `units.K` returns
# one kelvin as 0.086 meV, where the Boltzmann constant is implicit.

units = Units(:meV, :angstrom);

# ### Crystal cell
#
# A crystallographic cell may be loaded from a `.cif` file, or specified from
# atom positions and types.
#
# Start by defining the shape of the conventional chemical cell. CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ has
# cubic spacegroup 227 (Fd-3m). Its lattice constants are 8.5 ‚Ñ´ and the cell
# angles are 90¬∞. With this information, [`lattice_vectors`](@ref) constructs a
# 3√ó3 matrix `latvecs`. Columns of `latvecs` define the lattice vectors ``(ùêö_1,
# ùêö_2, ùêö_3)`` in the global Cartesian coordinate system. Conversely, columns
# of `inv(latvecs)` define the global Cartesian axes ``(\hat{x}, \hat{y},
# \hat{z})`` in components of the lattice vectors.

a = 8.5031 # (√Ö)
latvecs = lattice_vectors(a, a, a, 90, 90, 90)

# Construct a [`Crystal`](@ref) cell from spacegroup 227 in the ITA standard
# setting. Cobalt atoms belong to Wyckoff 8a, which is the diamond cubic
# lattice.

positions = [[1/8, 1/8, 1/8]]
cryst = Crystal(latvecs, positions, 227; types=["Co"])

# [`view_crystal`](@ref) launches an interface for interactive inspection and
# symmetry analysis.

view_crystal(cryst)

# ### Spin system

# A [`System`](@ref) will define the spin model. Each cobalt atom carries
# quantum spin ``s = 3/2``, with a ``g``-factor of 2. Specify this
# [`Moment`](@ref) data for cobalt atom 1. By symmetry, the same moment data
# also applies to cobalt atoms 2, 3, ... 7. The option `:dipole` indicates a
# traditional model type, for which quantum spin is modeled as a dipole
# expectation value.

sys = System(cryst, [1 => Moment(s=3/2, g=2)], :dipole)

# Ge et al. demonstrated that inelastic neutron scattering data for CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ is
# well modeled by antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor exchange, `J = 0.63` meV.
# Call [`set_exchange!`](@ref) with the bond that connects atom 1 to atom 3, and
# has zero displacement between chemical cells. Consistent with the symmetries
# of spacegroup 227, this interaction will be propagated to all other
# nearest-neighbor bonds. Calling [`view_crystal`](@ref) with `sys` now shows
# the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions as blue polkadot spheres.

J = +0.63 # (meV)
set_exchange!(sys, J, Bond(2, 3, [0, 0, 0]))
view_crystal(sys)

# ### Optimizing spins

# To search for the ground state, call [`randomize_spins!`](@ref) and
# [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) in sequence. For this problem, optimization
# converges rapidly to the expected N√©el order. See this with
# [`plot_spins`](@ref), where spins are colored according to their global
# ``z``-component.

randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys)
plot_spins(sys; color=[S[3] for S in sys.dipoles])

# The diamond lattice is bipartite, allowing each spin to perfectly anti-align
# with its 4 nearest-neighbors. Each of these 4 bonds contribute ``-J s^2`` to
# the total energy. Two sites participate in each bond, so the energy per site
# is ``-2 J s^2``. Check this by calling [`energy_per_site`](@ref).

@assert energy_per_site(sys) ‚âà -2J*(3/2)^2

# ### Reshaping the magnetic cell

# The most compact magnetic cell for this N√©el order is the primitive unit cell.
# Columns of the [`primitive_cell`](@ref) matrix provide the primitive lattice
# vectors as multiples of the conventional cubic lattice vectors.

shape = primitive_cell(cryst)

# Reduce the magnetic cell size using [`reshape_supercell`](@ref). Verify that
# the energy per site is unchanged after the reshaping the supercell.

sys_prim = reshape_supercell(sys, shape)
@assert energy_per_site(sys_prim) ‚âà -2J*(3/2)^2

# Plotting `sys_prim` shows the two spins within the primitive cell, as well as
# the larger conventional cubic cell for context.

plot_spins(sys_prim; color=[S[3] for S in sys_prim.dipoles])

# ### Spin wave theory

# With this primitive cell, we will perform a [`SpinWaveTheory`](@ref)
# calculation of the structure factor ``\mathcal{S}(ùê™,œâ)``. The measurement
# [`ssf_perp`](@ref) indicates projection of the spin structure factor
# ``\mathcal{S}(ùê™,œâ)`` perpendicular to the direction of momentum transfer, as
# appropriate for unpolarized neutron scattering. The isotropic
# [`FormFactor`](@ref) for Co¬≤‚Å∫ dampens intensities at large ``ùê™``.

formfactors = [1 => FormFactor("Co2")]
measure = ssf_perp(sys_prim; formfactors)
swt = SpinWaveTheory(sys_prim; measure)

# Select [`lorentzian`](@ref) broadening with a full-width at half-maximum
# (FWHM) of 0.8 meV. 

kernel = lorentzian(fwhm=0.8)

# Define a [`q_space_path`](@ref) that connects high-symmetry points in
# reciprocal space. The ``ùê™``-points are given in reciprocal lattice units
# (RLU) for the _original_ cubic cell. For example, `[1/2, 1/2, 0]` denotes the
# sum of the first two reciprocal lattice vectors, ``ùêõ_1/2 + ùêõ_2/2``. A total
# of 500 ``ùê™``-points will be sampled along the path.

qs = [[0, 0, 0], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 1/2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
path = q_space_path(cryst, qs, 500)

# Calculate single-crystal scattering [`intensities`](@ref) along this path, for
# energies between 0 and 6 meV. Use [`plot_intensities`](@ref) to visualize the
# result.

energies = range(0, 6, 300)
res = intensities(swt, path; energies, kernel)
plot_intensities(res; units, title="CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ LSWT")

# Sometimes experimental data is only available as a powder average, i.e., as an
# average over all possible crystal orientations. Use [`powder_average`](@ref)
# to simulate these intensities. Each ``ùê™``-magnitude defines a spherical shell
# in reciprocal space. Consider 200 radii from 0 to 3 inverse angstroms and
# collect 2000 random samples per spherical shell. As configured, this
# calculation completes in about two seconds. Had we used the conventional cubic
# cell, the calculation would be an order of magnitude slower.

radii = range(0, 3, 200) # (1/√Ö)
res = powder_average(cryst, radii, 2000) do qs
    intensities(swt, qs; energies, kernel)
end
plot_intensities(res; units, saturation=1.0, title="CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ Powder Average")

# This result can be compared to experimental neutron scattering data
# from Fig. 5 of [Ge et al.](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.064413)

# ### What's next?
#
# * For more spin wave calculations of this type, browse the [SpinW tutorials
#   ported to Sunny](@ref "SW01 - FM Heisenberg chain").
# * Spin wave theory neglects thermal fluctuations of the magnetic order. The
#   [next CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ tutorial](@ref "2. Landau-Lifshitz dynamics of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ at
#   finite *T*") demonstrates how to sample spins in thermal equilibrium and
#   measure correlations from the classical spin dynamics.
# * Sunny also offers features that go beyond the dipole approximation of a
#   quantum spin via the theory of SU(_N_) coherent states. This can be
#   especially useful for systems with strong single-ion anisotropy, as
#   demonstrated in the [FeI‚ÇÇ tutorial](@ref "3. Multi-flavor spin wave
#   simulations of FeI‚ÇÇ").
