# This is a Sunny port of [SpinW Tutorial
# 18](https://spinw.org/tutorials/18tutorial), originally authored by Goran
# Nilsen and Sandor Toth. This tutorial illustrates spin wave calculations for
# KCu‚ÇÉAs‚ÇÇO‚Çá(OD)‚ÇÉ. The Cu ions are arranged in a distorted kagome lattice and
# exhibit an incommensurate helical magnetic order, as described in [G. J.
# Nilsen, et al., Phys. Rev. B **89**, 140412
# (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.140412). The model follows [Toth
# and Lake, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter **27**, 166002
