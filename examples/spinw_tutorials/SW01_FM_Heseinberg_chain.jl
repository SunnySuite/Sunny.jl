# This is a Sunny port of [SpinW Tutorial
# 1](https://spinw.org/tutorials/01tutorial), originally authored by Goran
# Nilsen and Sandor Toth. It calculates the spin wave spectrum of the
# ferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor spin chain.

# Define a chemical cell for the spin chain lattice.  It is tetrahedral, with a
# short dimension of 3 ‚Ñ´ and two long dimensions of 8 ‚Ñ´. Observe that Sunny
# infers the spacegroup 'P 4/m m m' (123).

# View the crystal in 2D. The nearest neighbor bond along the chain is visible,
# and labeled `Bond(1, 1, [1, 0, 0])`. The first two atom indices must be 1,
# because there is only a single atom in the chemical cell. The vector `[1, 0,
# 0]` indicates that the bond includes a displacement of ``1 ùêö_1 + 0 ùêö_2 + 0
# ùêö_3`` between chemical cells.

# Sunny will always perform symmetry analysis based on the provided
# crystallographic information. For example, one can see that there are three
# different symmetry-equivalent classes of bonds up to a distance of 8 ‚Ñ´, and
# the symmetry-allowed exchange matrices are strongly constrained.

# Use the chemical cell to create a spin [`System`](@ref) with spin ``s = 1``
# and a magnetic form factor for Cu¬π‚Å∫. In this case, it is only necessary to
# simulate a single chemical cell. The option `:dipole` indicates that,
# following traditional spin wave theory, we are modeling quantum spins using
# only their expected dipole moments.

# Set a nearest neighbor exchange interaction of ``J = -1`` meV between
# neighboring atoms. That is, the total energy along each bond is ``J S_i
# S_{i+1}``. The exchange interaction will be propagated to all symmetry
# equivalent bonds in the system.

# which will be sampled approximately uniformly, involving 1000 sample points.
# Measure intensities for 200 energy values between 0 and 5 meV. Gaussian
# line-broadening is applied with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.1

# modern laptop. To decrease stochastic error, one can increase the number of
# sample points on each spherical shell.
