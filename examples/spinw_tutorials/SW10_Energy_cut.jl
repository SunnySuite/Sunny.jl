# # SW10 - Energy cut on square lattice
#
# This is a Sunny port of [SpinW Tutorial
# 10](https://spinw.org/tutorials/10tutorial), originally authored by Sandor
# Toth. It calculates the spin wave spectrum on a constant energy cut of the
# frustrated square lattice.

# Load Sunny and the GLMakie plotting package.
