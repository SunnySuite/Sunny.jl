# # SW06 - Complex kagome ferromagnet
#
# This is a Sunny port of [SpinW Tutorial
# 6](https://spinw.org/tutorials/06tutorial), originally authored by Bjorn Fak
# and Sandor Toth. It calculates the spin wave spectrum of the kagome lattice
# with multiple competing interactions.

# Load Sunny and the GLMakie plotting package.

# Construct a spin system with strongly ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor

# symmetry-inequivalent exchange types at distance 6 ‚Ñ´ (3rd nearest neighbor).
# The first type, associated with `J3a`, is a bond from atom 2 to atom 2 that
# passes over atom 3. The second type, associated with `J3b`, is a bond from
# atom 1 to atom 1 that passes through the center of an "empty" hexagon of the
# kagome lattice.
