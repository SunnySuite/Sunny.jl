## Contributing to Sunny.jl

Thanks for helping to improve Sunny! Please join us on the [Sunny Slack
server](https://join.slack.com/t/sunny-users/shared_invite/zt-1otxwwko6-LzPtp7Fazkjx2XEqfgKqtA).

- Ask usage questions on the `#helpdesk` channel.
- Code development will likely require coordination. For this, join us on the
  `#developers` channel. See also the [Tips for
  developers](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/wiki/Tips-for-developers)
  Wiki page.
- File GitHub issues for bugs or feature requests. Each issue should ideally
  include a minimimized example script that you have tested on the main
  development branch. The latter can be obtained from the Julia package manager
  with, e.g., `add Sunny#main` or `dev Sunny`.
