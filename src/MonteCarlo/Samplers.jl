    propose_uniform

Function to propose a uniformly random spin update in the context of a
[`LocalSampler`](@ref). In `:dipole` mode, the result is a random three-vector
with appropriate normalization. In `:SUN` mode, the result is a random SU(_N_)
coherent state with appropriate normalization.

For low-temperature Monte Carlo simulations, uniform spin proposals can be very
inefficient due to a high probability of rejection in the Metropolis
accept/reject step. Consider also [`Langevin`](@ref) sampling, which is
rejection free.

"""
    propose_flip

Function to propose pure spin flip updates in the context of a
[`LocalSampler`](@ref). Dipoles are flipped as ``ùêí ‚Üí -ùêí``. SU(_N_) coherent
states are flipped using the time-reversal operator.
"""
propose_flip(sys::System{N}, site) where N = flip(getspin(sys, site))

"""
    propose_delta(magnitude)

Generate a proposal function that adds a Gaussian perturbation to the existing
spin state. In `:dipole` mode, the procedure is to first introduce a random
three-vector perturbation ``ùêí' = ùêí + |ùêí| Œæ`` and then return the properly
normalized spin ``|ùêí| (ùêí'/|ùêí'|)``. Each component of the random vector ``Œæ``
is Gaussian distributed with a standard deviation of `magnitude`; the latter is
dimensionless and typically smaller than one. 

In `:SUN` mode, the procedure is analogous, but now involving Gaussian
perturbations to each of the ``N`` complex components of an SU(_N_) coherent
state.

In the limit of very large `magnitude`, this function coincides with
[`propose_uniform`](@ref).

Consider also [`Langevin`](@ref) sampling, which is rejection free.

    LocalSampler(; kT, nsweeps=1.0, propose=propose_uniform)

Monte Carlo simulation involving Metropolis updates to individual spins. One
call to the [`step!`](@ref) function will perform `nsweeps` of MCMC sampling for
a provided [`System`](@ref). The default value of `1.0` means that `step!`
performs, on average, one trial update per spin.

Assuming ergodicity, the `LocalSampler` will sample from thermal equilibrium for
the target temperature `kT`. 

The trial spin updates are sampled using the `propose` function. Options include
[`propose_uniform`](@ref), [`propose_flip`](@ref), and [`propose_delta`](@ref).
Multiple proposals can be mixed with the macro [`@mix_proposals`](@ref).

The returned object stores fields `ŒîE` and `ŒîS`, which represent the cumulative
change to the net energy and dipole, respectively.

!!! warning "Efficiency considerations"  
    Prefer [`Langevin`](@ref) sampling in most cases. Langevin dynamics will
    usually be much more efficient for sampling Heisenberg-like spins that vary
    continuously. `LocalSampler` is most useful for sampling from discrete spin
    states. In particular, [`propose_flip`](@ref) may be required for sampling
    Ising-like spins that arise due to a strong easy-axis anisotropy. For strong
    but finite single-ion anisotropy, consider alternating between `Langevin`
    and `LocalSampler` update steps.
