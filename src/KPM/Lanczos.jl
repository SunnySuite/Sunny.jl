# Reference implementation of the generalized Lanczos method, without
# consideration of speed. The input A can be any Hermitian matrix. The optional
# argument S is an inner-product that must be both Hermitian and positive
# definite. Intuitively, Lanczos finds a low-rank approximant A S ≈ Q T Q† S,
# where T is tridiagonal and Q is orthogonal in the sense that Q† S Q = I. The
# first column of Q is the initial vector v, which must be normalized. The
# Lanczos method is useful in two ways. First, eigenvalues of T are
# representative of extremal eigenvalues of A (in an appropriate S-measure
# sense). Second, one obtains a very good approximation to the matrix-vector
# product, f(A S) v ≈ Q f(T) e₁, valid for any function f [1].
#
# The generalization of Lanczos to an arbitrary measure S is implemented as
# follows: Each matrix-vector product A v is replaced by A S v, and each vector
# inner product w† v is replaced by w† S v. Similar generalizations of Lanczos
# have been considered in [2] and [3].

# An optimized implementation of the generalized Lanczos method. See
# `lanczos_ref` for explanation, and a reference implementation. No explicit
# orthogonalization is performed. This optimized implementation follows "the
# most stable" of the four variants considered by Paige [1], as listed on
# Wikipedia. Here, however, we allow for an arbitary measure S. In practice,
# this means that each matrix-vector product A v is replaced by A S v, and each
# inner product w† v is replaced by w† S v.
#
# In this implementation, each Lanczos iteration requires only one matrix-vector
# multiplication involving A and S, respectively. 
#
# Details:
#
# * The return value is a pair, (T, lhs† Q). The symbol `lhs` denotes "left-hand
#   side" column vectors, packed horizontally into a matrix. If the `lhs`
#   argument is ommitted, its default value will be a matrix of width 0.
# * The initial vector `v` must be normalized such that `√v S v ≈ 1`. (An
#   alternative implementation might absorb this scale into the return value
#   `lhs† Q`.)
# * After `min_iters` iterations, this procedure will estimate the spectral
#   bandwidth Δϵ between extreme eigenvalues of T. Then `Δϵ / resolution` will
#   be an upper bound on the total number of iterations (which includes the
#   initial `min_iters` iterations as well as subsequent ones).
# * The number of iterations will never exceed length(v). If this limit is hit
#   then, mathematically, the Krylov subspace should be complete, and the matrix
#   T should be exactly similar to the matrix A S. In practice, however,
#   numerical error at finite precision may be severe.
# * Accumulation of numerical roundoff error can lead to significant artifacts
#   in some cases. See https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/pull/339 for
#   examples. An explicit orthogonalization step may be considered for future
#   work. But note that there can be mixing between near-degenerate eigenvalues
#   even when the number of Lanczos iterations is small.
