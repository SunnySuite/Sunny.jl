# Welcome

Sunny provides powerful tools to simulate equilibrium and non-equilibrium
magnetic phenomena from microscopic models. It also facilitates calculation of
the dynamical spin structure factor $\mathcal{S}(𝐪,ω)$ for direct comparison to
experimental scattering data.

[**Feature highlights**](@ref "Why Choose Sunny?") include symmetry-guided modeling
and interactive visualization. Sunny also offers novel simulation capabilities
that reflect [theoretical advances](@ref "Advanced theory made accessible") in
quantum magnetism.

[**Browse the tutorials**](@ref "1. Spin wave simulations of CoRh₂O₄") to get
started. See also [SpinW ports](@ref "SW01 - FM Heisenberg chain") for
traditional spin wave theory.

[**Library Reference**](@ref) lists all functions and their doc-strings.
