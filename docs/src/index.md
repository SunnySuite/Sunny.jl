# Welcome

[Sunny](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/) provides powerful tools to
simulate equilibrium and non-equilibrium magnetic phenomena from microscopic
models. It also facilitates calculation of the dynamical spin structure factor
$\mathcal{S}(𝐪,ω)$ for direct comparison to experimental scattering data.

[Why Choose Sunny?](@ref) lists feature highlights. The design of Sunny is
closely tied to our team's [theoretical advances](@ref "Advanced theory made
accessible") in quantum magnetism.

Learn by browsing the [CoRh₂O₄ tutorial](@ref "1. Spin wave simulations of
CoRh₂O₄") and subsequent ones. See also the [SpinW ports](@ref "SW01 - FM
Heisenberg chain") for traditional spin wave theory.

The [Library Reference](@ref) lists all functions and their doc-strings.
